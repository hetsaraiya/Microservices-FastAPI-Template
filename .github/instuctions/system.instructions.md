Always follow best practices for modularization, including:

- Use dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability.
- Apply the single responsibility principle to keep modules focused and maintainable.
- Encapsulate implementation details and expose only necessary interfaces.
- Favor composition over inheritance for flexibility and reusability.
- Organize code into logical packages and modules.
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions.
- Document module interfaces and usage.


# NOTE: These instructions are intended exclusively for Claude 4.
# Do not attempt to execute or test the code you generate.
# Write only minimal, clear comments that are easy to understand.

# Additional guidelines:
# - Focus on concise, maintainable, and idiomatic code.
# - Ensure all code is production-ready and adheres to modern best practices.
# - If unsure, prefer clarity and simplicity over cleverness.
